Henry:

Yesterday, I reviewed the topics covered in yesterday's lecture.
Today I'm planning on doing further review on topics covered in today's training lecture as well as doing some progress on the project.
The issue I'm currently facing is figuring out what to do on the project now that it's been re-scoped.

Christine:

1) What did they do yesterday? 
	-Created study guide.
2) What will they do today? 
	-Write code and study
3) What progress are they making on project 1 and are they updating the Trello cards with their status? 
	-I'm ready to start writing code. Trello cards are up to date.
4) Are they running into any challenges/issues? 
	-None to report today.

Peter:

Yesterday I updated the Trello Board and did some studying.
Today I plan on doing more studying as well as work on the project.
No challenges besides figuring out what goes where on the project.

Aidan:

I ended up splitting things up on project 1 as well as starting to incorporate age and date of birth.
I'm going to focus on reviewing the notes to get ready for QC on Monday.
An issue I'm currently facing is that being confused about reorgainizing project 1.

Leo:

Yesterday, I started on reviweing yesterday's lecture notes and did some practicing on IntelliJ.
Today, I'll start studying this weekend to prepare for QC.
An issue I'm facing is trying to get down the concepts of classes and objects.
